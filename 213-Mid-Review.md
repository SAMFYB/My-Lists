Summary and Key Concepts from Lecture Slides

### Bits, Bytes, Integers (Part I)

- Why use bits?
  - Easy to store with bi-stable elements
  - Reliable in transfer
- Byte = 8 bits
  - 1 byte: 00000000 to 11111111 in binary
  - 1 byte: 0 to 255 in decimal
  - 1 byte: 00 to FF in hex
- Data representation in C (32 vs. 64)
  - char = 1, 1
  - short = 2, 2
  - int = 4, 4
  - long = 4, 8
  - float = 4, 4
  - double = 8, 8
  - pointer = 4, 8
  - size_t = \_, 8
- Encode "true" as 1 and "false" as 0 (boolean algebra)
